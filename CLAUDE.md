# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple portfolio website/resume project consisting of:
- HTML file (resume.html) - contains the structure of the resume
- CSS file (resume.css) - contains the styling for the resume

## Project Structure

- `resume.html`: The main HTML file containing the resume structure with sections for:
  - Header with personal information
  - Work experience
  - Personal projects
  - Education
  - Skills

- `resume.css`: The CSS file with styling for the resume including:
  - Overall page layout and container styling
  - Section styling
  - Responsive design for smaller screens

## Development Workflow

As this is a simple HTML/CSS project, no build tools or package managers are currently used. To view the resume, simply open the `resume.html` file in a web browser.

### Testing Local Changes

To preview changes locally:
1. Make edits to the HTML or CSS files
2. Open or refresh `resume.html` in a web browser

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be made:
- Add JavaScript functionality for interactive elements
- Implement a build process for minification and optimization
- Convert to a static site generator or framework (e.g., React, Vue)
- Add dark/light mode toggle
